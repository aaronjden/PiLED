# PiLED
Project for controlling LEDs with a Pi

Here is the example that I used to get started
https://projects.drogon.net/raspberry-pi/gpio-examples/tux-crossing/gpio-examples-1-a-single-led/

You need to have WiringPi installed first
http://wiringpi.com/download-and-install/

Then use gpio readall to find out the name of the port you want to enable. I use GPIO. 4 in this example
